# Investigating the connection between course grades and student participation in research-based assessments

This directory is the work I completed as an undergraduate reseracher during my 2021 summer REU at Boston University.

This work was completed under the advice of Dr. Manher Jariwala.

## Abstract

Low-stakes research-based assessments are opportunities for professors to understand and integrate course transformation built on pedagogical research. These assessments often come in the form of pre- and post-tests, such as the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation -- the usefulness of which, however, relies on voluntary student participation. A prior study by Nissen et al. investigating participation rates as well as performance outcomes in low-stakes assessments found a possible connection between student participation rates and final course grades. We explore this connection at a different large research university with pre- and post-test participation rates and course grade data from a data set of more than 2000 students using statistical methods from the previous paper.
